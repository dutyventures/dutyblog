<p>An MVP (Minimum viable product) is a basic, launchable version of the product that supports minimal yet must-have features (which define its value proposition). An MVP is created with an intent to enable faster time to market, attract early adopters, and achieve product-market fit from early on.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-the-mvp-development-process">What is the MVP Development Process?</h1>

<p>An MVP has just the basic functionalities that demonstrate the product and its ability to solve a user problem.</p>

<p>It is building a slice across the whole development process rather than one layer at a time.</p>

<p>Less development time means lower development costs. The faster the product is launched to users, the faster the business will receive feedback. This means they can work on improving their product, and release an updated version quickly.</p>

<p>In order to build the smallest functioning version of our product, we need to identify the core features that we can‚Äôt do without, and the ‚Äúnice to have‚Äù features we need to save for later iterations.</p>

<h1 id="salary">Salary</h1>

<p>Under the assumption that you are a recent graduate or student, you don‚Äôt react have much experience. Even if you do, the chances are that a small company is going to pay you more than your market price (the average price that a company is willing to pay you given your skills). The reason behind this is quite simple. A small company can be gone tomorrow, so they will try to give you more money in order to make up for the job security they cannot guarantee. Keep in mind that a small company sometimes have more strict deadline imposed by the investors or the executives. And since you are new to this field, make sure you understand that you stay longer at the office. That‚Äôs the second reasons a startup can give you more money. Some of them can even give you equity. While in the beginning they don‚Äôt mean much, on the long run there is still a chance to skyrocket.</p>

<h1 id="stress">Stress</h1>

<p>This is simple: the smaller the company, the bigger the stress. Think about it: if you are the only one in the company, you are in charge of all the things that can go wrong. If there are two of you, the reasonability splits, and so on. While the responsibility for each employees is not equal, chances are the less employees a company have, the more areas you need to be in charge of.</p>

<h1 id="perks">Perks</h1>

<p>This include: vacation days, food, snacks, drinks, health, dental and vision care and / or the alike. From.my experience, early stage startups offer a very limited set of these. But if you join a startup at their growth rate, you may be surprised if what perks can give them. Check out Airbnb‚Äôs office for example. It‚Äôs pretty cool.</p>

<h1 id="experience">Experience</h1>

<p>This is the last one I want to focus on. Chances are that if you are working at a startup, it is going to fail. It‚Äôs nothing personal, just statistics. If the startup is going to succeed, you will be very happy. If not, you still have valuable experience that every copmany is looking for.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>In conclusion, I‚Äôd say it is usually better to work for a startup in the beginning of your career, as you will grow much faster compared to working at a big company.</p>
