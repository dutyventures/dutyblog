Companies or individuals tend to hire software developers to help them with their projects when they don’t have the time, skills, or manpower to do them on their own. But to do so, you need to know what type of software developer you have to hire and how much it will cost you before starting to search for one.

## The entry-level
#### Experience: 0-2 years
#### Cost: $20 to $40 per hour
Entry-level developers or junior engineers are new developers that have the necessary skills to be able to achieve some simple tasks. They work with mid-level and senior-level software engineers to test, develop and update software applications or programs and are usually assigned to work on routine tasks helping familiarize them with the codebase of the company and develop their programming skills. After gaining some more experience and working on more complex projects entry-level software engineers would move into more senior roles.

## The mid-level
#### Experience: 2-4 years
#### Cost: $40 to $50 per hour
They are relatively experienced programmers who have already spent some years in this profession, their coding skills are more complete, and have already worked on other projects. They usually have enough experience to work on projects independently but should still be supervised by other senior developers to ensure minimal errors. They usually work as part of a team so they can have each other check for errors in the code thread. Mid-level developers are a good choice as long as the project is not too complex.

## The senior-level or software engineer
#### Experience: 5+ years
#### Cost: $60 to $100 per hour
They perform various development duties, such as coding and web development. They may also specialize in a specific area, oversee projects, and manage other junior developers. They are the developers that can also offer their expertise in marketing and the business transactions of their company. Unlike the other categories, senior-level developers can write custom macros, optimize the IDE and solve most of the problems they encounter. You’ll often see this type of developer take the role of the project manager in remote teams, because of their experience.

Choosing the right developer for your project is the key, so before starting your project, make sure you have defined your needs. If the project is not too important and the tasks are quite easy no need to look for a senior developer, a junior or mid-level one will be enough, and they will allow you to save some money.
On the contrary, if you intend to create several rather complex interconnected applications, in this case, the skills of a remote team led by a senior developer would be needed.
