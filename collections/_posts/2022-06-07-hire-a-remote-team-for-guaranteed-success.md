# A remote software development team is essential for your success. Read this to find out why !

Have you ever thought about outsourcing your software project? It may be the ideal solution for your business or directly for you and your company!

I know that it can scare you, not having as much control as you want on the progress of a project does not always please everyone, and trusting anyone is not as easy as you might think. Nevertheless, using a third party company can save your life in many cases, and even help you grow much faster and easier than you thought.

To get an idea, read this article to better understand what we are talking about.

Indeed, hiring a team to take care of your project for you can be the right solution in many cases: whether you are looking to save money, to temporarily expand your team, or simply because you don't have the skills to do it yourself. Outsourcing has always been a good alternative to hiring.

Unlike other fields, IT outsourcing often ends up in a long-term partnership (when the contracted company is reliable), due to the multiplicity of tasks to be performed and the duration of the projects. The advantages offered by this system are the following:

----------------------

## Speed in the execution

Because by contacting specialists in their fields, it will be much easier and faster to carry out the project. A team of computer specialists in the technology you want to implement in your company, will be much faster than a team of internal computer specialists who do not know the technology as well.

----------------------

## Autonomy in the progress of the project

Usually the teams are composed of both coders and project managers, who will manage the team and make sure that deadlines are met. This will allow you to focus on other tasks and not worry about the project. If needed, the project manager assigned to the team will come back to you for clarification, or your opinion if the team is facing a particularly difficult or delicate situation.

----------------------

## Saves time and money

Rather than having to hire a team, which will take you and your recruiters a lot of time and money, outsourcing is easier. You won't have to post your job ad on all the social networks and in all the local newspapers, because most of the time these teams are looking for work themselves, so there is a good chance that you will be contacted directly.

Moreover, if you don't have carry out this type of project very often, outsourcing every time you need (maybe even with the same team) is always more advantageous than hiring specialists in your company.

----------------------

So if you have a software project that has been waiting for a long time and you don't know how to complete it, consider outsourcing. There is certainly a team that will be able to satisfy you (of which we are surely a part) and if it is not the case you can always end the contract (with us for example, the first month is free. I put it like that, you never know).


As for our experience, we have had many contracts that started as simple outsourcing tasks and turned into real collaborations over time. So go ahead, just find a team you get along with (again, we're still here!), and the project will work.
