But, there is more to it than just that, and to know if this kind of job fits you, you have to ask yourself some questions before applying to a remote job or accepting a job offer.

## First, think about interactions:

If you don't mind having fewer interactions with your team and colleagues, then working from home would be perfect for you. You can have complete freedom over your work hours and you won’t have to worry about office politics or being judged by others. However, if you're someone who prefers more interaction with your team members and coworkers, then working remotely may not be the best option for you. Being able to contact other team members will still be possible as many remote teams use different apps to keep in touch such as Slack, Google Meet, and Discord, ... But chatting with your colleagues or socializing and getting to know the other team members will be more difficult than in a physical office.

## Then, think about skills:

If you feel like you're skilled enough to be able to complete most tasks on your own without needing immediate help from others, then working remotely may be a good option for you. If you're not sure of your skills or feel like they need some improvement, then working in an office with other human beings may be the better choice. This is especially true for young employees or graduates, who are taking on their first jobs and might not have all the needed skills at the beginning. Working remotely can still be a thing even in those situations, but you'll have to make sure that you can contact your team members or managers and that they are willing and available to help you in case you need any help. On the other side, if you're a freelancer, working remotely is something you should definitely consider. You'll have more freedom and flexibility to work on your own schedule, which can be very important if you're juggling multiple projects at once.

## Don't forget about your relationship with work:

On the one hand, if you don't feel motivated by working at home, on your own, and feel detached from the company, it's not good. Your motivation will drop fast and you'll start procrastinating and be less efficient. These can also lead to depression in some cases and the feeling that your role in the company is not that important after all. If this happens, you should first try and talk to someone around you and especially to your managers or boss so that the problem can be solved as quickly as possible.
On the other hand, if you are the type of person that doesn't know when to stop working the outcome would be a bit similar. Working at home doesn't mean that you have to sacrifice everything for work and that your personal life doesn't matter. So working extra hours or late at night shouldn't be a habit to develop if you don't have any important projects or deadlines to respect. Doing this can be especially dangerous and lead to burnout.
If none of these are problematic for you, working remotely can then be a good alternative.

## Pay attention to your tasks:

And most importantly link them to your current hardware. If you need some expensive stuff that is not provided by the company (which can also be a sign that the job might not be the one for you) then working from home, on your own would be quite difficult. So to accept any remote work propositions, make sure that the job s fits your skills and the technology you use. Don't be afraid to ask during the interview about any required equipment and see if the company will provide it to you or not.

## Finally, do you like your own comfort?

If it is the case and if you feel like you have anything you need at home, and that the job provides you with everything you imagined from a remote job, then go for it and to let your chance slip through. Working remotely can also allow you to develop your project on the side.

----------------------

Working remotely is a good way to carry out a professional activity while being at home and working in your comfort. But to do so you have to make sure that you'll be able to carry out all your tasks with fewer interactions than in a physical job. If you feel like working the whole week from home is too much, but still want to have some days on your own, you should try a hybrid method allowing you to spend some days at home as well as some at the office.
