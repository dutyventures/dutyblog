Software development is a complex process that involves a great deal of planning, development, and testing. Despite the best intentions of developers, mistakes can and will happen. These mistakes can be costly, both in terms of time and resources, and can lead to a subpar product that doesn't meet the needs of its intended users. 


### The first mistake to avoid is a lack of proper planning and requirement gathering. 

This is one of the most common mistakes made in software development. Without a clear understanding of what the software needs to do and who it needs to serve, it is easy to get sidetracked or create a product that doesn't meet the needs of its users. This is why it is essential to have a solid plan in place and to gather requirements from stakeholders and users before beginning development.

### The second mistake is a lack of testing. 

Testing is an essential part of software development and is critical for ensuring that the software is working as intended. Failure to test the software properly can lead to bugs and errors that can be costly and time-consuming to fix. Therefore, it is important to have a comprehensive testing strategy in place and to test the software at all stages of development.

### The third mistake is poor code quality. 

Code quality is important for the maintainability and scalability of the software. Poor code quality can lead to bugs and errors, making the software difficult to maintain and update. Therefore, it is essential to have a code review process in place and to adhere to coding standards to ensure that the code is of high quality.

### The fourth mistake is inadequate documentation. 

Proper documentation is essential for ensuring that the software is easy to understand and maintain. Without adequate documentation, it can be difficult for others to understand how the software works and how to make changes to it. It is important to have a documentation strategy in place and to keep it up to date throughout the development process.

### The fifth and final mistake is a lack of collaboration and communication. 
Collaboration and communication are critical for software development. And without those, it can be difficult to ensure that everyone is on the same page and working towards the same goals. It is important to establish clear lines of communication and to encourage collaboration among team members through different tools and activities.


As a developer, working in a team or giving access to your work to a colleague or friend can help you make sure you haven't made any mistakes. Of course, the easiest and most efficient way would be to have a dedicated team or person testing all of these programs, but this can be complicated for freelancers or small companies/startups with only a few employees. So starting with mutual aid is also good.

As for companies that would like to outsource the design of an application to specialists, a good indicator of quality can be the price. Don't try to save as much as possible on this part of the project, just as you shouldn't invest your entire budget. Consulting or contacting former clients of the company you want to work with before committing to them can be a good idea.

We would also add that the development of the application is just as important as the ease with which you are able to reach the company once your product is finished, so, make sure that the company can stay by your side in case you need help.
