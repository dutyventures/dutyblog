Being alone at home with all the distractions you can find around you can quickly become a problem for your productivity and stop you from achieving your tasks on time."

This is why you need to set some boundaries and take some actions in case start feeling more and more distracted while working from home.

Here are 5 tips that will surely help you improve your productivity and keep on track:

## Invest in a Proper Working Environment
Spending some money to have better working conditions at home is certainly worth it, and we like to repeat it. As we already wrote in a previous article about [setting up your remote office](https://blog.dutyventures.com/blog/2022-10-05-set-up-remote-office-properly/), it is important to have the right accessories on your desk so that you don’t lose time searching for all the information you need. It is also really important for you to buy the right hardware and software needed for your activity, but also the right office equipment. You should first think about buying a good desk and nice chair so that you are comfortable at work and only then invest in other accessories.

Doing so will definitely help you stay focused on what you do instead of trying to find the right position or search for the documents you need. This might be one of the most important steps in creating a healthy remote environment.


## Keep Your Workspace Clean
The second step is to keep that space clean, it's useless to invest in an ergonomic office with tons of compartments for storage if you don't take care of it and throw your papers in the first free corner of your workspace. Having a clean space will first of all allow you to find your way around better in case you need something, but also to work in better conditions, cleaner, and without any discomfort. This way you won't risk spilling your cup that has been lying on the desk for 3 days when you want to pick up a pencil. This is a very important step in creating a healthy workspace, but also in establishing a work routine. For example, you may decide to clean and tidy your desk every morning before you start work or every evening when you are finished.


## Separate Work from Life
As we already tackled this point in a dedicated article about [how to find the balance between working hours and private life](https://blog.dutyventures.com/blog/2022-06-22-remote-work-life-balance/), separating your work from your private life is even more important when you work remotely.
To do so, there are two main steps to apply:
- Set boundaries
- Mark the transition
Decide to set up your work set up in a dedicated room if you have the space, or at least try to isolate yourself from the rest of the house and the activities that might be going on. Working in the kitchen can quickly become a problem if you live with your parents or if you are not alone in your apartment. In addition to that, it is very important to make a transition between the time you are working and the time you have decided that your day is over. For example, cleaning your desk can be helpful, or turning off all your devices and deciding to go out for a breath of fresh air can also be nice.


## Communicate!
If you don’t know how you should communicate with your remote team yet, don’t worry we have something for you [here](https://blog.dutyventures.com/blog/2022-10-20-how-to-stay-in-touch-with-your-team/). You have tons of apps at your disposal that allow you to stay in touch with other members of your team and interact with them. Just try to adopt the same one that your company uses so you can communicate more effectively. 
It is then very important to communicate with other employees daily to be kept informed of the progress of projects for the most part but also and above all to feel integrated into the company's processes. This will also prove to the other team members and your boss that you are indeed working and that you are not taking it easy.


## Move!
Keeping productive is easier when you are active, so think about having some physical activity and don’t stay seated at your desk the whole day. As we explain very well [in this article](https://blog.dutyventures.com/blog/2022-09-27-stay-healty-remote/), practicing physical activity and being active does not necessarily mean that you have to wake up every day at 5:00 a.m. to go running or do your workout at the gym. 
If you like this type of activity you can schedule a time during the day for it, but simply going for a walk in your garden, taking out the trash, or going to the coffee shop around the corner for a cup of coffee is also enough. The goal is to be able to relax for a few moments and not think about what you have to do.


----------------------

The main concepts here are “live your life” and “make it comfortable”, this way you’ll be more effective at what you do and avoid wasting time doing anything else.
