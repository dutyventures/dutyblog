Remote working has numerous advantages, one of which is that it convinces both companies and workers in terms of work/life balance. 

However, there are also drawbacks to remote working, such as a risk of employee burnout, as many individuals struggle to disconnect after work. 

## To renew your passion, it's important that you cultivate a sense of harmony, calmness, and peace of mind.

----------------------

##  But how can you unplug when you finish your shift? 
## Set boundaries.

----------------------

You may do this by signing out of all work-related channels at the end of the day, or by muting communication and email apps from your phone. You may actively disconnect by creating boundaries and informing people of these restrictions. In turn, by conveying this to your coworkers, you will unintentionally model good practices for them.


Another form of a boundary to establish is to notify people that you are unavailable beyond a reasonable time (that you think relevant to your business hours), including that you are unable to answer emails after this period. This can go both ways, as you also need to respect your coworkersâ€™ time off, just like yours.

----------------------

## Mark the transition

Moreover, whether you choose to workout at the end of the day, change into more comfy clothes before you sign-out, or take a warm shower to transition from the working half of your day to the relaxing one, it's beneficial to switch modes by doing a specific thing when you leave work. Over time, this habit should become something automatic.

If you're actually concerned about an impending emergency, this is what we recommend on top of all these: allow calls. If anything is truly an urgent matter, you can trust that your colleagues will pick up the phone rather than rely on unanswered SMS.

----------------------

## Final word

And so, it's no secret that being overworked can result in a number of negative impacts on our physical and mental health. The most crucial aspect of setting boundaries to keep in mind is that they require practice. We also need to find a way of making these into routines. So, the next time you find yourself thinking about work in your spare time, simply accept it as natural and harmless, but not necessarily urgent. Your wellbeing is the number one priority.
