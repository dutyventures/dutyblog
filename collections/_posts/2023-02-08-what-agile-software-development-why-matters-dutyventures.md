## What is agile software development?

Agile software development is a method of #coding software that focuses on process flexibility, collaboration with others, and customer satisfaction. 

Instead of following a strict plan, agile software development involves creating and regularly improving small parts of the software and collecting feedback from customers. In this way, the final product always meets the customer's needs and wishes.

For example, imagine you want to create a new application for your company. Instead of creating a detailed plan for the entire app and building it all at once, work with a team to build small parts of the app (such as the login screen or the main menu) and get feedback from your customers along the way. This way, you can make sure the final product is exactly what your customers want.

## Why is this important?

This approach to project management helps teams deliver high-quality software quickly and efficiently. Agile software development can help teams improve their software development process and deliver better #software in less time. 
   
As you can easily see, there are significant benefits to using this method for your team or company. So, here are the main things you can expect:
   
### Faster Delivery:
Agile Software Development prioritizes delivering working software quickly, often in a matter of weeks or even days. This allows teams to respond to customer needs and market changes in real time, and to get feedback from customers on the software being developed. 

For example, if a customer requests a new feature, an Agile team can add it to the next sprint and deliver it in the following iteration, rather than waiting for months to deliver a complete product.
  
  
### Improved Collaboration:
Agile Software Development values collaboration between team members and customers, leading to better communication and faster problem resolution. Teams work together in cross-functional teams, with regular meetings and retrospectives to discuss progress, identify and resolve issues, and plan future work. 

For example, daily stand-up meetings can help teams stay on track and ensure everyone is working towards the same goal.
  
  
  
### Increased Flexibility:
Agile Software Development allows teams to adapt to changes in customer needs and market conditions, making your software development process more flexible and resilient. This is achieved by regularly reassessing priorities and adjusting the development plan based on changing circumstances. 

For example, if a competitor launches a new product with a similar feature, an Agile team can quickly pivot its focus to include that feature in its next sprint.


### Better Quality Software:
Agile Software Development prioritizes delivering working software over documentation and planning, ensuring that your team is focused on delivering the best software possible. By delivering working software early and often, teams can get feedback from customers and make improvements, leading to a higher-quality end product. 

For example, an Agile team might discover that a feature they thought was important is not actually needed, and they can remove it, saving time and effort.


### Customer Satisfaction:
Agile Software Development puts the customer at the center of the software development process, leading to increased customer satisfaction and better long-term relationships. By involving customers in the development process, teams can ensure they are delivering what the customer wants, and by delivering working software frequently, customers can see progress and provide feedback. 

For example, an Agile team might invite a customer to a sprint review, where they can demo the software and get feedback on what is working well and what can be improved.


----------------------


Agile Software Development is a powerful approach to software development that can help teams deliver better software. So, if you're looking to improve your software development process, consider adopting an Agile approach, and don't be afraid to experiment to find what works best for your team. 

Delivering working software frequently, improving collaboration, and increasing flexibility could help your team get better and build better relationships with customers.
