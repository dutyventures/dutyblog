#### Our team will understand your vision and turn it into a polished product using the best development practices


But let us tell introduce ourselves first:


Our DNA is made of corporate ex-employees, start-up founders and the top talent in Product, UX/UI, Software development and Machine & Deep Learning. We came together from various backgrounds with one vision: to bring a lean, user-centric approach to product innovation and software development by completely understanding the business needs before building anything. 

- We work with the best and brightest in tech talent to ensure you get high-quality tech architecture. 
- For each developer we onboard we go through at least 100 candidates. 
- Once onboarded our employees stay long-term, meaning they have a deep knowledge of the company and the processes we use.


### Why us?

As startup founders ourselves and with a corporate background, we have experienced many of the struggles on both sides. We know there is more to a successful product than technology, so we will always look at your product from a business standpoint.

Having worked with numerous founders and business leaders from various industries, we have learned to adapt to new challenges quickly. Our experience and insights will help you build a scalable, high-quality product that effectively solves your users' problems.


### What can we do for you?

Most app developers can write code, but few can build a web or mobile app that is powerful and has the user at a fingertip. We are dedicated to being your most valued strategic partner, that goes beyond just delivering code.

Our team of tech experts help businesses generate ideas, build products, and accelerate growth through digitalisation. We help envision, plan, design, develop, integrate, deploy and support software solutions. Our dedicated development teams are here to ensure your success and provide you with the support on every stage of the software development process.


### How do we work? Apart from excellent, we work fully remote

We are a distributed team working round the clock on different time zones to ensure great communication and delivery of your product.

You can decide your involvement. You can work close to the team or you can have a dedicated Product Owner who will be your representative in the team and will keep you up to date with the process.

We have some predefined processes that will be presented to you, but we are also very flexible and we can adapt easily, depending on your needs and availability.


### Final word

We don’t want to help you build a full-featured product only to discover the market doesn’t want it. We want you to succeed. We will focus on the vital features needed to test your product’s main assumptions - leaving unnecessary features behind, or saving them for later iterations.
